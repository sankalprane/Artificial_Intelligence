The problems are taken from the Assignments given by <b>Professor Piotr Gmytrasiewicz</b> while teaching Artificial Intelligence at University of Illinois at Chicago and uploaded after taking his consent.

The book which I used to study for this course is <b>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4th US edition<b>. The slides for the course can be accessed by clicking [here](http://aima.eecs.berkeley.edu/slides-pdf/)

The code for every program is written in C++. And can be run by using any [online compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) and just typing in the input in the standard text input.
